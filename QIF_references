Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) files

The Quicken interchange format (QIF) is a specially formatted text (ASCII) file that enables Quicken transactions to be moved from one Quicken account register into another Quicken account register, or to or from other programs that support the QIF format.

Note: For Quicken to translate data from a text file into the Quicken register as transactions, the text file must be in the QIF format.

Required File Formatting

Each transaction must end with a symbol, indicating the end of entry. Each item in the transaction must display on a separate line. When Quicken exports an account register or list, it adds a line to the top of the file that identifies the type of account or list. Listed below are the header lines Quicken adds to the exported files:

Header	            Type of data
!Type:Bank	        Bank account transactions
!Type:Cash	        Cash account transactions
!Type:CCard	        Credit card account transactions
!Type:Invst	        Investment account transactions
!Type:Oth A	        Asset account transactions
!Type:Oth L	        Liability account transactions
!Account	        Account list or which account follows
!Type:Cat	        Category list
!Type:Class	        Class list
!Type:Memorized	    Memorized transaction list

Quicken can be configured to import all transfers, regardless of whether Ignore Transfers is selected when the file is imported. To do this, add a line to the file being imported into the Quicken account. Use a text editor or word processor to put the following line immediately after the header line at the top of the file:

!Option:AllXfr


Items for Non-Investment Accounts
Each item in a bank, cash, credit card, other liability, or other asset account must begin with a letter that indicates the field in the Quicken
register. The non-split items can be in any sequence:

S	Category in split (Category/Transfer/Class)
E	Memo in split
$	Dollar amount of split
^	End of entry
Note: Repeat the S, E, and $ lines as many times as needed for additional items in a split. If an item is omitted from the transaction in the QIF file, Quicken treats it as a blank item.

Items for a Memorized Transaction List

Immediately preceding the ^ character, each entry must end with one of the following file indicators to specify the transaction type.
KC, KD, KP, KI, KE

With that exception, memorized transaction entries have the same format as regular transaction entries (non-investment accounts). However, the Date or Num field is included. All items are optional, but if an amortization record is included, all seven amortization lines must also be included.

 QUICKEN INTERCHANGE FORMAT (QIF)

Overview
You can export transactions from a Quicken account register to a
specially formatted text file and import data to a Quicken register
from the same type of text file.  This text file MUST be formatted
as a Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) file.  For Quicken to
translate data from a text file into the Quicken register as
transactions, the data must be in the QIF format.

Procedure
Basic Procedures:
* Each transaction must end with a * symbol
* Each item in the transaction must appear on a separate line
* When Quicken exports an account register, it adds a line at the
 top of the file that identifies the type of account.  Here are
 the header lines Quicken adds to the exported files:

  !Type:Bank
  !Type:Cash
  !Type:CCard
  !Type:Invst
  !Type:Oth A
  !Type:Oth L

* You can add a line to a file to be imported into Quicken account
 to force Quicken to import all transfers, regardless of whether
 Ignore Transfers is selected when the file is imported.  Use a
 test editor or word processor to put the following line right
 after the header line at the top of the file:

  !Option:AllXfr


Items for non-investment accounts

Each item in a bank, cash, credit card, other liability, or other
asset account must begin with a letter that indicates the field in
the Quicken register.  The non-split items can be in any sequence:

 D Date
 T Amount
 C Cleared status
 N Number(check or reference number)
 P Payee
 A Address (up to five lines; the sixth line is an optional
  message)
 L Category (Category/Subcategory/Transfer/Class
 S Category in split (Category/Transfer/Class)
 E Memo in split
 $ Dollar amount of split
 ^ End of the entry

Items for investment accounts
 D Date
 N Action
 Y Security
 I Price
 Q Quantity (Number of shares or split ratio)
 C Cleared Status
 P. Text in the first line for transfers and reminders
 M Memo
 O Commission
 L Account for the transfer
 $ Amount transferred
 ^ End of the entry

Repeat the S, E, and $ lines as many times as needed for additional
items in a split.  If an item is omitted from the transaction in the
QIF file, Quicken treats it as a blank item.
